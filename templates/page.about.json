Both these of aspects drew us to Standard Wax and we are now ready to refresh and expand this year. <\/p><p>Sam Thompson, the founder, began this company 11 years ago from her kitchen. She grew her passion into a  well-known and successful business not only throughout Arizona but also nationally. Standard Wax candles were sold all over Phoenix but also carried by Crate & Barrel and Anthropologie. Our goal is re-establish a strong retail presence and expand our offerings this year. <\/p><p>Sam offically passed the torch to Liz who is focusing on her background in retail and expertise in people, process, and presentation to take Standard Wax even further. <\/p><p>Liz's right hand, Tiernan, has been with Standard Wax for 3 years and is the guru for everything candles. As our Operations Manager, she oversees everything we need to do to get the job done. She is the best mom to her 4 year old, Marlowe.

I’m Tiernan. I’m the Operations Manager at Standard Wax and have been here for the past 3 years learning about all things candles, fragrance and small business. Let me tell you, I LOVE my job.

I am a mom to the most amazing, intelligent, and funny 4 year old.
